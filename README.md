# Project-Manager

App made by nodejs that uses some phone services and has backend office.
2nd thing I did was add app.js file to the repository
3rd comment added, not from visual code, but from the github repository edit file page 
4th comment, this is practice, objective is to now send this comment or push to github without looking at the video.
